# Resistor Ratio Calculator

A simple calculator that returns a combination of resistors from E12 or E24 series, based on the user-specified ratio R2/R1 and tolerance.

Can aid in the design of voltage dividers or specific OpAmp gain.

The output of the calculator is saved to a text file.

This repository includes .replit and Makefile for easy integration into Repl.it web based IDE.
